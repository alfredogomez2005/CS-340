How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The best way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable are to start small. Being so new to the industry, coding seems to be very complex. The more I try to write, the more errors I seem to run into. CRUD was helpful because it allows us to create, read, update, and delete the code. The code itself is very complex, but if done properly it can make my life easier. I also liked that most of the code was already written. I will have to continue to work on the code to create muscle memory.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The way that I approach problems are to look over the material that I'm provided and try and come up with a solution. In this project, I worked one thing at a time. By working this way, I'm able to focus on one thing at a time and check for errors. Compared to other assignments, this was very well laid out to help me figure things out. As far as techniques and strategies to use in the future, I plan to practice with the code and read over the material to continue practicing with MongoDB. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists use technology to solve complex problems. They work with servers, code, users, and peripherals. All of this matters because in today's day and age, everything has a computer. Without computer scientists, who would work on the problems that arise. With this project, I would work with a team. I've learned that more minds are better than one. Having everything synced with the repository is great because it allows me to upload the files and have others on the team work on the code as well.
